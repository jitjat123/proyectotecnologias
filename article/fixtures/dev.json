BYE BYE 404 profits from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">git</a>&nbsp;to manage the contributions of a geographically distributed development team. Developers push code to the repository where a software integration manager moderates and approves their patches. Once the patch meets the quality standards, the integration manager triggers the build and test process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the build and test process, the test server creates a new environment from scratch by taking advantage of container technologies. At the end of this step, the server builds a new container registry that will be available for the next process.

On this date,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.noirlab.edu/\">NOIRLab</a>&nbsp;had its &ldquo;first light&rdquo; [1] and was born to unite 5 successful astronomical programs: Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, Community Science &amp; Data Center, Gemini Observatory, Kitt Peak National Observatory and Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Each program brings a long and rich history of scientific breakthroughs spanning for nearly three decades, locations in 3 different time zones, and thousands of digital assets, including breathtaking images and videos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">1 October 2019 marks also the beginning of the collaboration between NOIRLab and Enciso Systems. With more than 10 years supporting web operations for astronomical observatories around the world, Enciso Systems [2] joined forces with local companies [3] to develop and migrate a website of astronomical proportions, literally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>By far, this is the most challenging project I have led in my career as a software developer. We had a complex code base developed over many years that we customized and optimized to meet the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the customer.

We are proud of what we have accomplished with our local talent.</em>&rdquo; affirms Edison Arango.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>We dealt with an impressive, and sometimes overwhelming, amount of content during migration.

    "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Many of the things you learned at the university are not going to help you because things are completely different outside. The world of software development is a rapidly growing world where you must keep yourself updating to new technologies to try to be on fire. That is a great advantage of internships, because while you are still studying, you can start preparing yourself for the real world and start adjusting to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Enciso Systems is a company founded by Javier Enciso to satisfy the demand for professional IT services to clients in Europe and the United States. My partners Jonathan Garzon, Alejandro Vivas, Diego Palacios and I, Javier Riveros, started about four months ago to work at Enciso Systems as software developer interns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">So, being part of Enciso Systems as a software development intern really brings you a new way of thinking about the working world because you start acquiring new skills every day that are going to help you to get a job or a new opportunity once you have finished your career, we also have our English teacher&#39;s support, Alvaro Trujillo, who teaches us twice a week to reinforce our English knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">To be a part of a team like the one we have at Enciso Systems makes work easier because if anyone is stuck or has a problem, any other team member can contribute to solve that problem. There is a good working environment at the company because all the team members know one another, it has helped us to create a better working space where anyone can give his opinion and suggest new ways of working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">At Enciso Systems we are currently working on the migration of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/djangoplicity/djangoplicity\">Djangoplicity</a>&nbsp;from Python 2 to Python 3.This project is important because it supports the web operations of several scientific organizations around the world. This system has more than ten years of development and hundreds of thousands of lines of code written in Python. Also, we are working along with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://altix.co/\">Altix</a>&nbsp;which is another company with a really good team that has helped us to improve as developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Finally, I encourage fellow students to look for opportunities in local IT companies, you can&rsquo;t imagine how you can learn and contribute at the same time, while keeping close contact with your friends.&nbsp;</p>",

    "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Teen Astronomy Caf&eacute; program offers high school students opportunities to interact with top-level astronomers, try the computer programs they use, and play with actual data from the cosmos. Exoplanets, the birth and death of stars, the structure of the universe, dark matter and gravitational lenses are among the topics covered on the Caf&eacute;s, by means of short lectures and hands-on computer activities designed using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter Notebooks</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The emergency caused by COVID-19 marked a breaking point for the program, as the development of the on-site Caf&eacute;s had to stop and move to virtuality. An Enciso Systems&rsquo; team led by Juan-David Vargas worked hand in hand with project coordinators to create versions of the Teen Astronomy Caf&eacute; Notebooks that can be executed online using tools such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\">Google&rsquo;s Colab</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mybinder.org/\">Binder</a>, enters the e-Teen Astronomy Caf&eacute;s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">e-Teen Astronomy Caf&eacute; Notebooks, and its auxiliary files, had to be adjusted to be self-contained and work completely online, with minimal user-intervention, ensuring that student experience is not hindered by any possible technical problems. This new phase of the program not only ensures its permanence during confinement times, but also allows the program to widen its scope and reach new potential students in other parts of the country, and the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>The Teen Astronomy Caf&eacute;s in Tucson have brought high school students together with undergrads, graduate students and astronomers as role models to pathways toward STEM fields</em>&rdquo; says Connie Walker, a scientist at NOIRLab who specializes in education and public outreach and leads the Teen Astronomy Caf&eacute; program. &ldquo;<em>Students are provided with opportunities to experience science first hand, talking to astronomers and analyzing the same data astronomers do. Thinking about things they never thought possible. Engaging in intellectual challenges. And just maybe, getting inspired to pursue a STEM field. Now with the help of Enciso Systems, we can take the program beyond Tucson.</em>&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>&ldquo;</em><em>These programs have already had a positive influence on students in the Tucson area. The work that Enciso Systems has done enables us to bring the program to more sites nationally, and even internationally, with the potential to spur students around the world toward STEM careers.</em><em>&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;adds Mark Newhouse, Manager of Arizona Education and Engagement at NOIRLab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>Being involved in such an interesting project has been quite an adventure to me: having weekly meetings in English (not my mother tongue), where we had to discuss topics that went from the most specific technical issues to wider educational and student-experience related stuff, working with leading technology, and receiving insightful feedback from teachers, students, Connie and Mark, has helped me grow as a computer scientist, and potential teacher and communicator. I look forward to staying involved in the future development of the program</em>&rdquo; concludes Juan-David Vargas, lead developer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Finally, Enciso Systems expects to replicate similar STEM experiences at the Llanos Orientales region to benefit local communities and expand the horizon of young talented participants.

    "abstract": "Supporting the evolution of digital business processes is the subject of a research project by Enciso Systems, Universidad Nacional de Colombia and Universidad de los Llanos. Through a postdoctoral grant, a team of researchers will enhance the software's capabilities to detect changes in business process models, identify necessary modifications, and help developers update source code. The goal is to bridge the gap between updates to business process models and corporate capabilities to optimize",
    "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Business processes are constantly evolving. Companies identify customer expectations, user experiences, and environmental opportunities to gain insight and improve their processes. Unfortunately, there is a gap between the need to update business processes to meet market changes and corporate capabilities to improve the software that supports these processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Many companies use work suites called&nbsp;<em>Business Process Management Systems</em>&nbsp;(BPMS). With these systems, business experts and analysts use models to represent, simulate, and implement business processes. Erroneously, these experts often expect that any change in the models will produce a change in the corresponding software. However, many times these model changes do not reach the software. For example, in technologies such as JBoss JBPM, Camunda BPM, and IBM Websphere BPM; there are cases where a change to the model requires manual source code updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The research group of Enciso Systems, the National University of Colombia and the University of Los Llanos [1] works together on the BMEu-Trace project. This research project aims to improve the software&#39;s capabilities to detect changes in business process models, identify necessary modifications, and help developers update source code. In particular, the researchers use information about the coincidence between the elements of the model and their respective source code in order to determine the impact of any changes in the processes. At the current stage, the research team is working on the design (and identification) of tools that can maintain these correspondences (also known as traceability links) automatically, which implies an improvement in the maintenance times of the support software, in addition to facilitating the work of software developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>The evolution of business processes is key for companies interested in digital transformation. These companies usually implement a continuous cycle where the business processes, after the initial design, are always in constant change, either through improvements or via their redesign. The software that supports these processes cannot be an impediment for this cycle to take place. Our work will help companies streamline their digital transformation processes</em>&rdquo;, says Olga Vega, who leads the research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>Our work with the universities help us to provide the most advanced technologies to our partners and clients. Collaboration projects like this help us to provide technologies that enable new business strategies.</em>&rdquo;, mentions Javier Enciso, CEO of Enciso Systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The most recent research proposal from Enciso Systems, Universidad Nacional de Colombia and Universidad de los Llanos received a grant from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://minciencias.gov.co/\">Minciencias</a>, as part of CFP 891 of 2020 &ldquo;<em>Fortalecimiento de vocaci&oacute;n y formaci&oacute;n en CTeI para reactivaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica en el marco de la post-pandemia 2020</em>&rdquo; . This grant will finance the hiring of a doctor in Systems Engineering for a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>This grant will help us to accelerate our research. Using this fund, we can build new tools that automatically maintain the correspondences among the elements in the BPM models and the source code that implements these processes. We expect to use that information to analyze the impact of the changes, to provide hints to the developers and to automatically propagate some changes. We will use some on-the-edge technologies and theories to achieve this.</em>&rdquo; concludes Jaime Chavarriaga, one of the researchers in the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With this project, participating institutions ratify the benefits of the University-Company-State collaboration. In addition, the participants&#39; commitment to disseminate and apply the investigation results in the productive sector.</p>",

    "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope will revolutionize astronomy. Launched on 25 December 2021, this powerful research marvel will provide a deeper view into the early Universe and it will enable astronomers to answer fundamental questions regarding our origin. Once the scientific results will be available, there is an imperative need for a website where the general public finds news, images and videos we love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://www.djangoplicity.com/\">Djangoplicity</a>&nbsp;[1] is the content management system behind&nbsp;<a href=\"https://esawebb.org/\">esawebb.org</a>. After a number of iterations with the ESA/Webb international team [2], the newly released website contains the following sections: 3D Model, Mission Overview, Fact Sheet, Nominal Deployment Sequence Video, Timeline, What&rsquo;s New, and Social Media. Diego Palacios led the frontend development, Alejandro Vivas worked on the infrastructure configuration, Alejandro Vergara and David Ramirez composed the music, Juan-David Vargas coordinated the technical team, and Javier Enciso was the executive producer. Also, special acknowledgement to Edison Arango from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://helixsoft.com.co/\">Helix Software</a>&nbsp;for his fantastic insights regarding backend configuration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>For me, space was always a mystery, in the best of ways. A source of knowledge waiting to be discovered, to unravel its mysteries. That is perhaps why science fiction literature fills that space in my life, since I did not dedicate myself to science, I chose the path of music. I am proud to be part of this great project that is JWST. Perhaps my contribution is not great, it is not even scientific, but I am sure it is a bridge between the impressive discoveries to come and the common people. From the moment the idea of creating thematic music for the project came up and I was added to the team, everything has flowed. Composing as a team, conceptualizing and producing the work that they will hear has been a process that I have enjoyed more than anticipated; I feel like this is my opportunity to give back to the universe how great I have received.</em>&rdquo; explains music composer Alejandro Vergara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">More web content will be available after the Telescope reaches its final observation place.
